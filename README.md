# Post-AGI Enthusiasts Webpage

## Project Description

This project aims to build a dark-themed, community-driven webpage for post-AGI enthusiasts, researchers, and polymaths. The focus is on intellectual stimulation, inclusivity, and futurism while ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.

## Key Requirements

### Visual Style

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Void Black (#0A0A0A), Astral Indigo (#1A1F3D)
- Accents: Bioluminescent Teal (#00C9A7), Stellar Gold (#D4AF37)
- Neutrals: Moonlit Gray (#E0E0E0), Eclipse Charcoal (#2D2D2D)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Geometric sans-serif (e.g., Space Grotesk)
- Body: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter)

### Core Sections

**Navigation Bar:**
- Links: Home, Blog, Forum, Polymath Library, Events, About
- Dark background with teal/gold hover effects.

**Hero Section:**
- Animated "Interconnected Minds" WebGL/Three.js network (glowing nodes morphing into neurons/fractals).
- Overlayed mission statement + CTA: "Join the Future â†’".

**Discussion Forum:**
- Subcategories: Ethical Frameworks, AGI Governance, Post-Scarcity Economics.
- Thread previews with reply counts, upvotes, and a "New Thread" button.

**Sidebar:**
- Quick links to Polymath Library, AGI Timeline, and Live Chat.

**Footer:**
- Newsletter signup, social media icons, and accessibility toggle.

### Animations & Interactions

- Landing page nodes pulse/react to scroll/cursor.
- Micro-interactions: Hover effects on cards/buttons, smooth transitions.
- Kinetic typography for section headers (text "assembles" on load).

### Design Philosophy

- Minimalist Futurism: Clean layouts, ample negative space, subtle gradients.
- Accessibility: AAA contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, alt text for animations.
- Responsive: Mobile-first grid, collapsible menus on smaller screens.

### Technical Specs

- Framework: React/Next.js for dynamic content.
- Animations: Three.js/WebGL for landing page, CSS/GSAP for micro-interactions.
- Backend: Firebase or Supabase for forums/user accounts.
